                        <h2>Hello, I'm <span class="highlight">Rishabh Shrivastava</span></h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm an engineering leader specialising in machine learning, search, and platform development, currently building scalable solutions at Mercari in Tokyo.</p>
                        
                        <h3>My Journey</h3>
                        <p>I come from India and have always loved mathematics, which eventually led me to pursue engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where I earned a Bachelor's and Master's in Electrical Engineering.</p>
                        <p>During university, I explored machine learning and computer vision through projects and research internships. In 2017, I was among two students selected for internships at the University of Tokyo and DMG Mori, where I worked on deep learning and image processing. These experiences not only shaped my passion for AI but also sparked my long-standing connection with Japan.</p>
                        <p>After joining Mercari as a new graduate, I grew from an ML engineer to an engineering manager, leading teams across machine learning, search, and platform reliability domains. Along the way, I developed a strong belief that great engineering culture is built through collaboration, ownership, and continuous learning â€” values I work to instil every day.</p>
